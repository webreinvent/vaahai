1. Process all documentation files to understand:
   - Project requirements and goals
   - Technical architecture and design patterns
   - Implementation details and API references
   - Business logic and workflows
   - Testing strategies and roadmap

2. Build a mental model of how the different components interact:
   - CLI commands and their handlers
   - Configuration management system
   - Agent architecture and collaboration
   - LLM provider integrations
   - Docker execution environment

3. Pay special attention to:
   - Multi-agent system design with Autogen

   - Agent responsibilities and interactions
   - Extension points and customization options

## EXPECTED OUTCOME
After processing this context, you should be able to:
1. Answer questions about the VaahAI architecture and design
2. Provide guidance on implementation approaches
3. Suggest solutions to technical challenges
4. Help with debugging and troubleshooting
5. Assist with extending or modifying the system

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- The project is organized into multiple directories with specific purposes
