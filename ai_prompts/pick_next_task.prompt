## WORKFLOW
Follow this complete workflow for task management and implementation:

### 1. Verify Previous Task Completion
- Review the code changes for the previous task
- Run appropriate tests to verify functionality
- Check that all acceptance criteria have been met
- Confirm that the implementation aligns with the project architecture
- If the task is incomplete, identify what remains to be done before proceeding

### 2. Update Documentation
- Update relevant documents in `/specs`, `/docs`, and `/ai_docs`
- Ensure implementation details are documented
- Update API documentation if applicable
- Add usage examples where appropriate
- Ensure the documentation reflects the current implementation

### 3. Create Git Commit
- Summarize the changes made for the previous task
- Include relevant task IDs in the commit message
- Describe the functionality that was implemented
- Note any architectural decisions made
- Create a commit with a clear, descriptive message

### 4. Create Merge/Pull Request
- Create a merge/pull request from the current branch to the `develop` branch
- Include a descriptive title that references the task ID
- Add a detailed description of the changes made
- Reference any related issues or tasks
- Request appropriate reviewers if applicable
- Add relevant labels and milestones

### 5. Select Next Task
- Review the current project status in `/specs/TASK_TRACKING.md`
- Identify tasks marked as "Not Started" that have no incomplete dependencies
- Prioritize MVP tasks and those that unblock multiple other tasks
- Consider the logical flow of implementation
- Update the task status in `TASK_TRACKING.md` to "In Progress"

### 6. Create New Branch
- Create a branch with a name that reflects the task ID and description
- Branch must be created from the previous task branch or from the `develop` branch
- Follow the project's branch naming conventions
- Push the branch to the remote repository

### 7. Understand Task Scope
- Read the task description thoroughly
- Review related documentation and requirements
- Understand how this task fits into the overall project
- Identify the specific deliverables for this task
- Define clear acceptance criteria

### 8. Create Implementation Plan
- Break down the task into smaller steps
- Identify the files that need to be created or modified
- Determine the classes, functions, and interfaces required
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Plan for testing and validation
- Present the plan for confirmation before proceeding

### 9. Implement the Task
- Follow the confirmed implementation plan
- Write clean, well-documented code
- Adhere to the project's coding standards
- Implement unit tests
- Ensure the code integrates well with existing components
