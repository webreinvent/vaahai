# IMPORTANT NOTES
- Tailor your review to the specified depth and focus areas
- Prioritize actionable feedback over nitpicking
- For security issues, always explain the potential impact and risk
- Consider the context and purpose of the code when making suggestions
- Be specific about where and why issues exist
- Include positive feedback along with criticism
- Provide concrete examples of how to fix issues
- If the code is high quality, acknowledge this while still suggesting improvements
