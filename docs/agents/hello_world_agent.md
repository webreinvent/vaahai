# HelloWorld Agent

## Overview

The HelloWorld agent is a simple demonstration agent that showcases the VaahAI agent architecture and AutoGen integration. It serves as both a test of the system's functionality and an example for developers creating new agents.

## Features

- Simple text-based interaction with a greeting response
- Full integration with Microsoft AutoGen 0.6.1
- Proper message handling and response extraction
- Fallback to mock agent when needed
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Usage

The HelloWorld agent can be run directly from the command line:

```bash
vaahai helloworld
```

This will initialize the agent and generate a greeting response.

## Implementation Details

### AutoGen 0.6.1 Compatibility

The HelloWorld agent is fully compatible with AutoGen 0.6.1, which has a significantly different message handling architecture compared to previous versions. Key implementation details include:

1. **Message Creation**: Uses `TextMessage` from `autogen_agentchat.messages` to create properly structured messages
2. **Cancellation Token**: Implements proper cancellation token handling required by AutoGen 0.6.1
3. **Response Extraction**: Correctly extracts response content from the `chat_message.content` attribute
4. **Error Handling**: Includes comprehensive error handling with fallbacks to mock implementations

### Configuration

The agent uses the VaahAI configuration system to retrieve LLM provider settings:

- API keys are retrieved from `llm.providers.[provider].api_key` with fallback to legacy paths
- Model settings are retrieved from `llm.providers.[provider].model`
- Default OpenAI model is set to `gpt-3.5-turbo` for broader compatibility

### CLI Command

The HelloWorld agent is accessible through a simplified CLI command:

```bash
vaahai helloworld
```

The command has been streamlined by:
- Removing the `run` subcommand
- Moving the run logic directly into the main command callback
- Setting `invoke_without_command=True` and `no_args_is_help=False` for direct execution

## Development

### Testing

To test the HelloWorld agent:

```bash
poetry run pytest vaahai/test/unit/agents/applications/hello_world/test_agent.py
```

### Example Implementation

For a simple example of how to use AutoGen 0.6.1 with VaahAI, see:

```bash
python examples/autogen_061_example.py
```

This example demonstrates proper message handling and response extraction with detailed logging.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the HelloWorld agent:

1. Ensure you have configured an LLM provider with `vaahai config init`
2. Check your API key is correctly set with `vaahai config get llm.providers.openai.api_key`
3. Review logs for detailed error messages
4. Verify AutoGen packages are correctly installed with `poetry show | grep autogen`
