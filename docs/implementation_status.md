## Contributing to Implementation

When contributing to the implementation:

1. Check the implementation status to identify components that need work
2. Update the implementation status when starting work on a component
3. Update the implementation status when completing work on a component
4. Ensure all tests pass for the implemented component
5. Update documentation to reflect the implementation
