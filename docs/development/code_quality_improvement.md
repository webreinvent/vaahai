# Code Quality Improvement Plan

This document outlines the plan for gradually improving code quality in the VaahAI project using the newly established development tools.

## Current Status

The project now has the following code quality tools set up:

1. **Pre-commit hooks** - Automatically run checks before each commit
2. **Black** - Code formatting
3. **isort** - Import sorting
4. **Flake8** - Linting

However, to allow for a smooth transition, the initial configuration is intentionally lenient. This allows the project to continue development while gradually improving code quality.

## Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (Current)

- ✅ Set up pre-commit hooks with basic checks
- ✅ Configure Black and isort with project standards
- ✅ Configure Flake8 with lenient settings
- ✅ Document development tools and workflow

### Phase 2: Gradual Improvement

1. **Address Unused Imports**
   - Systematically remove unused imports (F401 violations)
   - Update the Flake8 configuration to enforce this rule

2. **Fix Line Length Issues**
   - Gradually reduce the max line length from 130 to the target of 88
   - Refactor long lines to improve readability

3. **Address Other Linting Issues**
   - Fix bare except statements (E722)
   - Fix f-string issues (F541)
   - Fix unused variable issues (F841)

### Phase 3: Strict Enforcement

- Update Flake8 configuration to enforce stricter rules
- Remove ignore directives as issues are fixed
- Consider adding additional checks (complexity, docstrings, etc.)

## Implementation Strategy

### For New Code

All new code should follow the target standards:
- Maximum line length of 88 characters
- Proper import organization
- No unused imports or variables
- Proper exception handling

### For Existing Code

1. **Opportunistic Fixes**
   - Fix issues in files you're already modifying
   - Make small, focused changes

2. **Dedicated Clean-up Tasks**
   - Create specific tasks for addressing categories of issues
   - Prioritize fixes in core modules

## Configuration Targets

The target configuration for Flake8 is:

```ini
[flake8]
max-line-length = 88
extend-ignore = E203  # Black-compatible
exclude = .git,__pycache__,build,dist,.venv
```

## Monitoring Progress

Track code quality improvement over time:
- Run periodic code quality reports
- Monitor the number of violations
- Celebrate progress in reducing technical debt

## Best Practices

1. **Run pre-commit locally** before pushing changes
2. **Fix issues incrementally** rather than in large batches
3. **Document reasons** for any permanent ignores
4. **Keep configuration files** in sync with project requirements
