# Code Quality Improvement Plan

This document outlines the phased approach to improving code quality in the VaahAI project.

## Current Code Quality Tools

We currently use the following code quality tools:

1. **Code formatting** - Black and isort for consistent code style
2. **Linting** - Flake8 for identifying code issues
3. **Testing** - pytest for unit and integration tests

## Phase 1: Basic Code Quality (Completed)

- ✅ Set up Black for code formatting
- ✅ Set up isort for import sorting
- ✅ Set up Flake8 for linting
- ✅ Create basic test structure
- ✅ Document code quality tools and practices

## Phase 2: Enhanced Testing (In Progress)

- ✅ Expand unit test coverage
- ⏳ Add integration tests for all CLI commands
- ⏳ Set up test fixtures for common testing scenarios
- ⏳ Implement test coverage reporting
- ⏳ Establish minimum coverage requirements

## Phase 3: Advanced Code Quality (Planned)

- ⏳ Add type checking with mypy
- ⏳ Implement security scanning
- ⏳ Add complexity analysis
- ⏳ Set up automated dependency updates
- ⏳ Create custom linting rules for project-specific patterns

## Phase 4: Continuous Improvement (Planned)

- ⏳ Integrate code quality metrics into CI/CD pipeline
- ⏳ Implement automated code review comments
- ⏳ Create quality dashboards
- ⏳ Set up automated refactoring suggestions
- ⏳ Establish code quality improvement goals and tracking

## Best Practices

1. Run code quality tools locally before pushing changes
2. Address all code quality issues promptly
3. Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
4. Maintain or improve code coverage with each change
5. Review code quality reports regularly

## Metrics and Goals

- Current test coverage: 64%
- Target test coverage: 80%
- Current linting compliance: 95%
- Target linting compliance: 100%
- Current type checking coverage: 0%
- Target type checking coverage: 60%

## Continuous Integration

Code quality checks are run as part of our CI pipeline to ensure that all code meets our quality standards before being merged.
