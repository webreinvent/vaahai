Update the implementation status documents to reflect the current state of the Vaahai project:

1. Review the current implementation status in:
   - specs/implementation/implementation_status.md
   - specs/implementation/implementation_roadmap.md
   - README.md (implementation status table)

2. Update the status of tasks based on recent progress:
   - Mark completed tasks with ✅
   - Mark in-progress tasks with 🔄
   - Mark not started tasks with ⬜
   - Mark deprioritized tasks with ⏳

3. For in-progress tasks, update the detailed notes with:
   - Current progress and milestones achieved
   - Next steps and remaining work
   - Any blockers or challenges

4. For completed tasks, add detailed implementation notes:
   - Key components implemented
   - Design decisions and trade-offs
   - Integration points with other components

5. Update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of the status document.

6. Ensure all three documents (implementation_status.md, implementation_roadmap.md, and README.md) are consistent in their status reporting.
