Perform a comprehensive audit and update of all vaahai project documentation and implementation status based on recent progress and recent discussion:

1. Review the current implementation status and documentation in:
   - Implementation files:
     - specs/implementation/implementation_status.md
     - specs/implementation/implementation_roadmap.md
     - specs/implementation/task_tracking.md
     - README.md (implementation status table)
   - Documentation files:
     - ai_docs/ (AI_INTEGRATION.md, API_REFERENCE.md)
     - docs/ (usage.md, commands.md, autogen_integration.md)
   - Audit and update any inconsistencies or outdated information in docs, specs and ai_docs

2. Update task statuses based on recent progress:
   - Mark completed tasks with ‚úÖ
   - Mark in-progress tasks with üîÑ
   - Mark not started tasks with ‚¨ú
   - Mark deprioritized tasks with ‚è≥

3. For in-progress tasks, update with:
   - Current progress and milestones achieved
   - Next steps and remaining work
   - Any blockers or challenges

4. For completed tasks, add:
   - Key components implemented
   - Design decisions and trade-offs
   - Integration points with other components

5. Ensure all documentation consistently reflects:
   - The multi-agent architecture using Autogen
   - The specialized agent roles and responsibilities
   - The agent communication mechanisms
   - The CLI integration approach
   - The configuration options

6. Check for inconsistencies or outdated information across documents:
   - Ensure task statuses are consistent between files
   - Verify that feature descriptions match across documentation
   - Confirm that CLI commands and options are up-to-date

7. Update all "Last Updated" dates to the current date.

8. Propose specific updates to align all documentation with the current implementation status.

9. Ensure all three implementation documents (implementation_status.md, implementation_roadmap.md, and README.md) are consistent in their status reporting.
10. Update your memory as well
11. Confirm before proceeding to the next step.
