Help me identify and plan the next implementation task for the Vaahai Autogen integration:

1. Review the current implementation status from:
   - ./specs/implementation/implementation_status.md
   - ./specs/implementation/implementation_roadmap.md
   - ./specs/implementation/task_tracking.md

2. Consider the recently completed Hello World Agent MVP:
   - Base agent architecture is now established
   - Agent factory pattern is implemented
   - CLI integration mechanism is validated
   - Testing approach for agents is demonstrated

3. Identify the highest priority task that is currently marked as "in progress" or "not started" based on:
   - Task priority (P1 > P2 > P3)
   - Task dependencies (tasks with completed dependencies should be prioritized)
   - Current implementation phase progress
   - Strategic importance to the project

4. For the identified next task:
   - Provide a detailed implementation plan
   - List any dependencies or prerequisites
   - Suggest a file structure or location in the codebase
   - Outline key functions, classes, or methods to implement
   - Identify potential challenges and solutions

5. Include relevant code snippets or templates to kickstart the implementation.
6. After task completion, take an approval before implementation status, roadmap, task tracking documents, specs, ai_docs, docs and readme.md are updated.

Please be specific and actionable in your recommendations, focusing on concrete next steps rather than general advice.
