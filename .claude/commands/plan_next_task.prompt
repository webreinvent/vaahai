Help me plan the next implementation task for the Vaahai Autogen integration:

1. Review the current implementation status and roadmap.

2. Based on the implementation plan phases:
   - Phase 1: Setup (Autogen dependency, basic agent infrastructure)
   - Phase 2: Agent Development (specialized agents, prompt templates)
   - Phase 3: Orchestration (coordinator agent, workflow definition)
   - Phase 4: Integration (CLI connection, output formatting)

3. Ask me clarifying questions about:
   - Which specific component should be prioritized next
   - Any technical constraints or preferences
   - Required level of test coverage
   - Documentation needs alongside implementation

4. Propose a detailed implementation plan for the next task including:
   - Directory structure and file organization
   - Key classes, methods, and interfaces
   - Dependencies and integration points
   - Test approach
   - Expected challenges and mitigation strategies

5. Update the implementation roadmap and status documents if needed.

6. Provide a checklist of subtasks to track progress.
