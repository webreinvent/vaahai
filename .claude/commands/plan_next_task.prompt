Help me identify and plan the next implementation task for the Vaahai Autogen integration:

1. Review the current implementation status from:
   - ./specs/implementation/implementation_status.md
   - ./specs/implementation/implementation_roadmap.md
   - ./specs/implementation/task_tracking.md

2. Identify the highest priority task that is currently marked as "in progress" or "not started" based on:
   - Task priority (P1 > P2 > P3)
   - Task dependencies (tasks with completed dependencies should be prioritized)
   - Current implementation phase progress
   - Strategic importance to the project

3. For the identified next task:
   - Provide a detailed implementation plan
   - List any dependencies or prerequisites
   - Suggest a file structure or location in the codebase
   - Outline key functions, classes, or methods to implement
   - Identify potential challenges and solutions

4. Include relevant code snippets or templates to kickstart the implementation.

Please be specific and actionable in your recommendations, focusing on concrete next steps rather than general advice.
