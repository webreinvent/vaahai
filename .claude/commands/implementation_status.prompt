# Vaahai Implementation Status Prompt

## Purpose

This prompt helps AI tools understand the current implementation status of the Vaahai project, including which components and features have been completed, which are in progress, and which are pending. Use this information to ensure generated code aligns with the current state of the project.

## Current Implementation Status

The implementation status is tracked in detail in `/specs/implementation/implementation_status.md` and `/specs/implementation/implementation_roadmap.md`. Please review these documents to understand the current state of the project.

Key points to understand:

1. **Project Phase**: The project is currently in Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
2. **Strategic Shift**: The project has pivoted to integrate Microsoft's Autogen framework for a multi-agent approach to code review
3. **Completed Components**: 
   - P1-T001: Configuration Manager
   - P1-T002: CLI Application Skeleton
   - P1-T003: Code Scanner
   - P1-T005: CLI Command Simplification
4. **In-Progress Components**: 
   - P1-T007: Autogen Framework Integration
5. **Deprioritized Components**:
   - P1-T004: Basic Output Formatting (replaced by P1-T007)
6. **Next Tasks**: 
   - Complete P1-T007: Autogen Framework Integration
   - Begin P1-T006: Static Analysis Integration

## Autogen Integration Status

The Autogen integration (P1-T007) is currently in progress and includes:

1. **Setup Phase**:
   - Add Autogen as a dependency 
   - Create basic agent infrastructure 
   - Implement agent configuration loading 

2. **Agent Development Phase**:
   - Implement specialized agents 
   - Create prompt templates for each agent 
   - Define agent capabilities and limitations 

3. **Orchestration Phase**:
   - Implement the coordinator agent 
   - Define workflow between agents 
   - Create fallback mechanisms 

4. **Integration Phase**:
   - Connect Autogen system to the CLI 
   - Implement output formatting for agent results 
   - Add configuration options for agent customization 

## Task Dependencies

When implementing a component, be aware of its dependencies:

```
P1-T007 (Autogen Framework Integration)
├── Depends on: P1-T001 (Configuration Manager) 
├── Depends on: P1-T002 (CLI Application Skeleton) 
├── Depends on: P1-T003 (Code Scanner) 
└── Required for: P2-T004 (Agent Orchestration)
```

## How to Update Status

After completing implementation work, please update the status in the implementation tracking documents:

1. In `/specs/implementation/implementation_status.md`:
   - Update the component status from to or 
   - Add the completed task to the "Recently Completed Tasks" section
   - Update the "In-Progress Tasks" section

2. In `/specs/implementation/implementation_roadmap.md`:
   - Update the task status from  to  or 
   - Update the "Detailed Task Descriptions" section

3. In `README.md`:
   - Update the implementation status table

## Your Task

Based on the current implementation status:

1. Identify which components and features are already implemented
2. Understand the dependencies of the component you're working on
3. Ensure your implementation is compatible with existing components
4. Update the status tracking after completing your work
