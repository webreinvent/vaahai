Perform a comprehensive audit and update of all documentation to ensure alignment with the current Autogen integration focus:

1. Review and update the following documentation directories:
   - ./ai_docs (AI_INTEGRATION.md, API_REFERENCE.md)
   - ./specs (implementation_roadmap.md, implementation_status.md)
   - ./docs (usage.md, commands.md, autogen_integration.md)

2. Ensure all documentation consistently reflects:
   - The multi-agent architecture using Autogen
   - The specialized agent roles and responsibilities
   - The agent communication mechanisms
   - The CLI integration approach
   - The configuration options

3. Check for any inconsistencies or outdated information across documents.

4. Propose specific updates to align all documentation with the current implementation status.

5. Confirm alignment before proceeding to the next implementation step.
