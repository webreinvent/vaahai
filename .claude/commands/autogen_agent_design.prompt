Help me design and implement a specialized Autogen agent for the Vaahai multi-agent system:

1. Specify which agent type to design:
   - Language Detector Agent
   - Framework/CMS Detector Agent
   - Standards Analyzer Agent
   - Security Auditor Agent
   - Review Coordinator Agent
   - Custom agent type

2. Design the agent's:
   - Core responsibilities and capabilities
   - Input requirements and output format
   - System prompt template with clear instructions
   - Interaction patterns with other agents
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

3. Implement the agent with:
   - Integration with Autogen's Agent class
   - Configuration options and defaults
   - Prompt template management
   - Result processing and formatting
   - Testing strategy

4. Update relevant documentation to reflect the new agent implementation.

5. Provide examples of how this agent would analyze different code samples.
