# CLI Version Flag Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the standard `--version` flag in the VaahAI CLI and the resolution of CLI test failures related to parameter compatibility issues between Typer and Click.

## Version Flag Implementation

### Changes Made

1. Added the `--version` flag to the main CLI app:
   - Implemented in `vaahai/cli/main.py` as a global option
   - Used `importlib.metadata` to retrieve the package version
   - Added early exit with `typer.Exit()` when the flag is used

2. Changed the verbose flag from `-v` to `-V` to avoid conflict with the version flag:
   - Updated all documentation and help text to reflect this change
   - Maintained backward compatibility with the `--verbose` long option

3. Added context settings to customize help options:
   - Set `context_settings={"help_option_names": ["--help", "-h"]}` in the main Typer app

## CLI Test Failures Resolution

### Issue Description

The CLI tests were failing with the error: `TypeError: Parameter.make_metavar() missing 1 required positional argument: 'ctx'`. This was caused by incompatibilities between the Typer and Click versions being used.

### Root Cause Analysis

1. The error occurred during CLI help rendering in tests
2. It was traced to incompatibilities in Typer and Click parameter definitions
3. Specific issues included:
   - Using `exists=True` with `pathlib.Path` in `typer.Argument`
   - Using `Optional[Path]` directly as an option type

### Fixes Implemented

1. Updated dependency versions:
   - Pinned Typer at version 0.4.2
   - Upgraded Click from 8.0.0 to 8.0.4 for compatibility

2. Fixed parameter usage:
   - Removed unsupported `exists=True` from `typer.Argument` using `pathlib.Path`
   - Changed the global `--config` option type from `Optional[Path]` to `Optional[str]` with internal conversion to `Path`

3. Environment cleanup:
   - Removed stale bytecode files (`*.pyc` and `__pycache__`)
   - Refreshed Poetry lock file and reinstalled dependencies

## Testing

After implementing these changes, all 32 CLI-related unit tests passed successfully. The CLI now correctly displays version information with the `--version` flag and properly handles path arguments and options.

## Version History

- v0.2.17: Fixed CLI test failures by updating Click to 8.0.4 and fixing parameter usage
- v0.2.18: Added `--version` flag support and changed verbose flag to `-V`
