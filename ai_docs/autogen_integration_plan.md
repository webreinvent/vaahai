## Group Chat Integration

Based on our comprehensive research of Autogen's group chat functionality, we will implement the following integration approach:

### Group Chat Types

VaahAI will support the following group chat patterns from Autogen:

1. **RoundRobinGroupChat**: For simple, predictable agent interactions where each agent takes turns in a predefined order.
2. **SelectorGroupChat**: For dynamic conversations where agent selection depends on context.
3. **BroadcastGroupChat**: For gathering multiple perspectives by sending messages to all agents simultaneously.
4. **Custom Group Chat Implementations**: For specialized conversation patterns unique to VaahAI.

### Integration Architecture

The integration will follow an adapter pattern to ensure clean separation between VaahAI's components and Autogen's implementation:

1. **Agent Adapters**: VaahAI agents will adapt to Autogen's agent interface, allowing them to participate in Autogen group chats while maintaining VaahAI's architecture.

2. **Conversation Manager Adapters**: VaahAI's conversation management system will adapt to Autogen's group chat functionality, providing a consistent interface for VaahAI components.

3. **Message Adapters**: Messages will be transformed between VaahAI's format and Autogen's format to ensure seamless communication.

4. **Tool Integration**: VaahAI's tool system will be integrated with Autogen's tool calling capabilities to enable agents to use tools within conversations.

### Implementation Phases

The group chat integration will be implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1: Basic Integration**
   - Implement adapters for basic agent types
   - Support RoundRobinGroupChat pattern
   - Enable simple conversations with minimal configuration

2. **Phase 2: Advanced Integration**
   - Add support for SelectorGroupChat and BroadcastGroupChat
   - Implement custom termination conditions
   - Enable human-in-the-loop integration

3. **Phase 3: Custom Extensions**
   - Develop custom group chat implementations for VaahAI-specific use cases
   - Create specialized agent selection strategies
   - Implement advanced conversation management features

### Configuration Management

Group chat configuration will be managed through VaahAI's configuration system:

```toml
[autogen.group_chat]
type = "round_robin"  # or "selector", "broadcast", "custom"
max_rounds = 10
allow_repeat_speaker = false
send_introductions = true

[autogen.group_chat.termination]
max_messages = 50
completion_indicators = ["Task completed", "Solution found"]
```

## Integration Architecture

The integration architecture follows an adapter pattern to maintain clean separation between VaahAI and Autogen components. This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Decoupling**: Changes to Autogen's API won't directly impact VaahAI's core components.
2. **Flexibility**: VaahAI can extend or modify Autogen's functionality without altering the original code.
3. **Testability**: Adapters can be tested independently from both VaahAI and Autogen components.
4. **Future-proofing**: If needed, VaahAI could switch to a different framework with minimal changes to core components.

### Key Components

1. **Agent Integration Layer**:
   - `AutogenAgentAdapter`: Adapts VaahAI agents to Autogen's agent interface
   - `VaahAIAssistantAgent`: Extends the adapter with VaahAI-specific capabilities
   - `VaahAIUserProxyAgent`: Provides user interaction capabilities

2. **Group Chat Integration Layer**:
   - `AutogenGroupChatAdapter`: Adapts VaahAI's conversation manager to Autogen's group chat
   - `VaahAIRoundRobinChat`: Extends RoundRobinGroupChat with VaahAI-specific features
   - `VaahAISelectorChat`: Extends SelectorGroupChat with VaahAI-specific features

3. **Message Integration Layer**:
   - `MessageAdapter`: Transforms messages between VaahAI and Autogen formats
   - `ConversationHistoryAdapter`: Manages conversation history compatibility

4. **Tool Integration Layer**:
   - `ToolRegistryAdapter`: Registers VaahAI tools with Autogen
   - `ToolExecutorAdapter`: Executes Autogen tool calls using VaahAI's tool system

## Implementation Approach

Each task in this integration plan will be implemented following VaahAI's development workflow:

1. **Task Verification**: Verify the previous task is completed and tested
2. **Documentation Update**: Update relevant documentation in /specs, /docs, and /ai_docs
3. **Git Workflow**: Create detailed git commits and pull requests
4. **Task Selection**: Select the next task and update task_tracking.md
5. **Branch Creation**: Create a new branch following the project's branching strategy
6. **Task Analysis**: Analyze the scope of the task
7. **Implementation Planning**: Create a detailed implementation plan
8. **Implementation**: Implement the task after approval

## Dependencies and Requirements

## Success Criteria

The Autogen integration will be considered successful when:

1. All agent types can be instantiated and configured through the VaahAI system
2. Agents can communicate effectively in various patterns
3. Code can be executed securely in Docker containers
4. Multiple LLM providers can be used interchangeably
5. The system can be controlled through the VaahAI CLI

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are to:
