# Autogen Integration Plan for VaahAI

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating Microsoft Autogen framework into the VaahAI project, following the project's granular task structure and incremental development approach.

## Integration Strategy

The integration will follow VaahAI's preference for small, quickly achievable tasks that facilitate incremental development and frequent releases. The Autogen framework will be integrated as a foundational component from the beginning of the project.

   - Implement task prioritization
   - Add support for load balancing
   - Create task dependency management
   - Implement task progress tracking

### Phase 5: Integration with VaahAI CLI

1. **Command Line Interface**
   - Create CLI commands for agent management
   - Implement configuration via CLI
   - Add support for workflow execution
   - Create interactive mode for agent communication
   - Implement result visualization in terminal

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Create configuration file structure
   - Implement configuration validation
   - Add support for environment variables
   - Create configuration profiles
   - Implement secure credential storage

## Implementation Approach

Each task in this integration plan will be implemented following VaahAI's development workflow:

1. **Task Verification**: Verify the previous task is completed and tested
2. **Documentation Update**: Update relevant documentation in /specs, /docs, and /ai_docs
3. **Git Workflow**: Create detailed git commits and pull requests
4. **Task Selection**: Select the next task and update TASK_TRACKING.md
5. **Branch Creation**: Create a new branch following the project's branching strategy
6. **Task Analysis**: Analyze the scope of the task
7. **Implementation Planning**: Create a detailed implementation plan
8. **Implementation**: Implement the task after approval

## Dependencies and Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- Docker for secure code execution
- Access to various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Junie, Ollama)
- Autogen packages:
  - autogen-agentchat
  - autogen-ext with appropriate extensions

## Success Criteria

The Autogen integration will be considered successful when:

1. All agent types can be instantiated and configured through the VaahAI system
2. Agents can communicate effectively in various patterns
3. Code can be executed securely in Docker containers
4. Multiple LLM providers can be used interchangeably
5. The system can be controlled through the VaahAI CLI

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are to:

1. Update the task tracking document with the detailed Autogen integration tasks
2. Implement the first task: Setup Autogen Dependencies
3. Create a proof-of-concept implementation to validate the approach
