# Microsoft Autogen Framework Research

## Overview

Microsoft AutoGen is a framework for creating multi-agent AI applications that can act autonomously or work alongside humans. It provides a layered and extensible design that enables developers to use the framework at different levels of abstraction, from high-level APIs to low-level components.

## Core Architecture

AutoGen uses a layered architecture consisting of:

1. **Core API**: Implements message passing, event-driven agents, and local and distributed runtime for flexibility and power. It also supports cross-language support for .NET and Python.

2. **AgentChat API**: Implements a simpler but opinionated API for rapid prototyping. This API is built on top of the Core API and supports common multi-agent patterns such as two-agent chat or group chats.

3. **Extensions API**: Enables first- and third-party extensions continuously expanding framework capabilities. It supports specific implementations of LLM clients (e.g., OpenAI, AzureOpenAI), and capabilities such as code execution.

## Key Components

### 1. Agent Types

AutoGen provides several types of agents:

- **AssistantAgent**: An AI assistant that can process tasks and generate responses using LLMs.
- **UserProxyAgent**: Represents a human user in the system, allowing for human-in-the-loop interactions.
- **MultimodalWebSurfer**: An agent capable of browsing the web and processing visual information.
- **Custom Agents**: The framework allows for the creation of custom agents with specific capabilities.

### 2. Communication Patterns

AutoGen supports various communication patterns between agents:

- **Two-Agent Chat**: Simple back-and-forth communication between two agents.
- **Round-Robin Group Chat**: Multiple agents taking turns in a conversation.
- **Custom Group Chat Patterns**: Developers can define custom communication patterns for specific use cases.

### 3. Termination Conditions

Conversations between agents can be terminated based on various conditions:

- **TextMentionTermination**: Ends the conversation when specific text is mentioned.
- **Custom Termination Conditions**: Developers can define custom conditions for ending conversations.

### 4. Model Integration

AutoGen provides integration with various LLM providers:

- **OpenAI**: Integration with models like GPT-4o.
- **Azure OpenAI**: Integration with Azure-hosted OpenAI models.
- **Other Providers**: The framework is designed to be extensible to support other LLM providers.

## Developer Tools

AutoGen ecosystem includes two essential developer tools:

1. **AutoGen Studio**: Provides a no-code GUI for building multi-agent applications.
2. **AutoGen Bench**: Provides a benchmarking suite for evaluating agent performance.

## Installation and Requirements

- Requires Python 3.10 or later
- Core installation: `pip install -U "autogen-agentchat" "autogen-ext[openai]"`
- AutoGen Studio: `pip install -U "autogenstudio"`

## Code Examples

### Basic Assistant Agent

```python
import asyncio
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient

async def main() -> None:
    model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model="gpt-4o")
    agent = AssistantAgent("assistant", model_client=model_client)
    print(await agent.run(task="Say 'Hello World!'"))
    await model_client.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Web Browsing Agent Team

```python
import asyncio
from autogen_agentchat.agents import UserProxyAgent
from autogen_agentchat.conditions import TextMentionTermination
from autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat
from autogen_agentchat.ui import Console
from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient
from autogen_ext.agents.web_surfer import MultimodalWebSurfer

async def main() -> None:
    model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model="gpt-4o")
    # The web surfer will open a Chromium browser window to perform web browsing tasks.
    web_surfer = MultimodalWebSurfer("web_surfer", model_client, headless=False, animate_actions=True)
    # The user proxy agent is used to get user input after each step of the web surfer.
    user_proxy = UserProxyAgent("user_proxy")
    # The termination condition is set to end the conversation when the user types 'exit'.
    termination = TextMentionTermination("exit", sources=["user_proxy"])
    # Web surfer and user proxy take turns in a round-robin fashion.
    team = RoundRobinGroupChat([web_surfer, user_proxy], termination_condition=termination)
    try:
        # Start the team and wait for it to terminate.
        await Console(team.run_stream(task="Find information about AutoGen and write a short summary."))
    finally:
        await web_surfer.close()
        await model_client.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Integration Considerations for VaahAI

### 1. Architecture Alignment

AutoGen's layered architecture aligns well with VaahAI's design goals:

- **Core API**: Can be used for low-level message passing and agent management.
- **AgentChat API**: Provides a simpler interface for rapid prototyping of agent interactions.
- **Extensions API**: Enables integration with different LLM providers as specified in VaahAI requirements.

### 2. Agent Implementation

VaahAI can leverage AutoGen's agent framework to implement:

- **Language Detector Agent**: For detecting programming languages in code.
- **Framework Detector Agent**: For identifying frameworks and libraries used in projects.
- **Reviewer Agent**: For code review functionality.
- **Auditor Agent**: For security and compliance auditing.
- **Reporter Agent**: For formatting and presenting findings.
- **Applier Agent**: For applying suggested code changes.
- **Committer Agent**: For managing git commits.

### 3. Multi-Agent Collaboration

AutoGen's group chat functionality can be used to implement VaahAI's multi-agent collaboration requirements:

- Agents can work together to analyze code from different perspectives.
- Round-robin or custom communication patterns can be defined based on specific tasks.
- Termination conditions can be set to end conversations when specific criteria are met.

### 4. LLM Provider Integration

AutoGen's Extensions API supports multiple LLM providers, aligning with VaahAI's requirement to support:

- OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
- Anthropic Claude
- Junie
- Local models via Ollama

### 5. Docker Integration

AutoGen can be integrated with Docker for code execution, which aligns with VaahAI's Docker execution environment requirements.

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Custom Agent Development

**Challenge**: Developing specialized agents for VaahAI's specific requirements.
**Solution**: Extend AutoGen's base agent classes and implement custom functionality.

### 2. LLM Provider Integration

**Challenge**: Ensuring consistent behavior across different LLM providers.
**Solution**: Create abstraction layers and standardized prompts to handle provider-specific differences.

### 3. Performance Optimization

**Challenge**: Managing performance with multiple agents and large codebases.
**Solution**: Implement chunking, caching, and selective analysis as mentioned in VaahAI's risk assessment.

### 4. Security Considerations

**Challenge**: Handling API keys and sensitive information securely.
**Solution**: Leverage AutoGen's configuration management and add secure storage mechanisms.

## Next Steps for VaahAI Integration

1. Create a proof-of-concept implementation with basic agent types.
2. Test integration with different LLM providers.
3. Develop custom agents for VaahAI-specific tasks.
4. Implement and test multi-agent collaboration patterns.
5. Integrate with Docker for secure code execution.
