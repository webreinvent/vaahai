## Purpose

These documents are designed to provide AI tools with a deep understanding of the Vaahai system to enable:

1. **Effective Code Generation**: AI tools can generate code that aligns with the architecture and design patterns of Vaahai
2. **Intelligent Code Review**: AI tools can provide context-aware code reviews based on Vaahai's business logic and design principles
3. **Accurate Documentation**: AI tools can generate or update documentation that maintains consistency with the existing system
4. **Informed Refactoring**: AI tools can suggest refactoring that respects the established patterns and principles

## How to Use This Documentation

AI tools should:

1. Start with AI_CONTEXT.md for a high-level overview
2. Refer to ARCHITECTURE.md to understand system structure
3. Consult specific documents (API_REFERENCE.md, DESIGN_PATTERNS.md, etc.) for detailed information
4. Use IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md to understand development priorities and sequence
