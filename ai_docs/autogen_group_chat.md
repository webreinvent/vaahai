## Introduction to Group Chats

Group chats in Autogen provide a structured way for multiple agents to collaborate on complex tasks. They enable multi-agent conversations with different communication patterns, allowing for specialized agents to contribute their expertise to solve problems collectively.

Key benefits of Autogen's group chat functionality include:

- **Specialized Agent Collaboration**: Agents with different capabilities can work together on complex tasks
- **Structured Conversation Flow**: Different conversation patterns can be implemented based on task requirements
- **Flexible Termination Conditions**: Conversations can be terminated based on various criteria
- **Human Integration**: Human participants can be included in the conversation flow
- **Extensibility**: Custom group chat managers can be implemented for specialized use cases

## Group Chat Types

Autogen provides several built-in group chat implementations:

### 1. RoundRobinGroupChat

This is the simplest form of group chat where agents take turns in a predefined order. Each agent gets an opportunity to contribute to the conversation in sequence.

**Key characteristics**:
- Fixed speaking order based on the order of agents in the list
- Each agent speaks exactly once per round
- Simple to configure and predict
- Suitable for tasks where each agent has a clear, distinct role

**Implementation example**:
```python
group_chat = RoundRobinGroupChat(
    agents=[user_proxy, language_detector, code_reviewer, security_auditor, reporter],
    max_round=15  # Limit the conversation to 15 rounds
)
```

### 2. SelectorGroupChat

This more advanced group chat type uses a "selector" agent to determine which agent should speak next based on the conversation context. This allows for more dynamic conversations where the most appropriate agent is chosen at each step.

**Key characteristics**:
- Dynamic speaking order determined by a selector agent
- Can adapt to the conversation flow
- More complex but more flexible
- Suitable for tasks where agent selection depends on conversation context

**Implementation example**:
```python
selector_agent = SelectorAgent(
    name="selector",
    system_message="You are a conversation manager who selects the next speaker based on the conversation needs.",
    model_client=model_client
)

group_chat = SelectorGroupChat(
    agents=[user_proxy, code_generator, code_reviewer, security_auditor],
    selector=selector_agent,
    max_round=20
)
```

### 3. BroadcastGroupChat

This group chat type sends messages to all agents simultaneously and collects their responses. It's useful for gathering multiple perspectives or solutions to a problem.

**Key characteristics**:
- Messages are sent to all agents at once
- All agents respond to each message
- Responses can be aggregated or processed individually
- Suitable for tasks requiring multiple independent perspectives

### 4. Custom Group Chat Implementations

Autogen allows for custom group chat implementations by extending the `GroupChat` base class. This enables the creation of specialized conversation patterns tailored to specific use cases.

**Example use cases for custom implementations**:
- Priority-based agent selection
- Context-aware agent filtering
- Hierarchical conversation structures
- Domain-specific conversation patterns

## Group Chat Configuration

Group chats in Autogen can be configured with various parameters to control their behavior:

### Common Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| `agents` | List of agents participating in the chat | Required | Order matters for RoundRobinGroupChat |
| `max_round` | Maximum number of conversation rounds | None | Prevents infinite conversations |
| `speaker_selection_method` | Method to select the next speaker | Depends on chat type | Only applicable to certain chat types |
| `allow_repeat_speaker` | Whether an agent can speak multiple times in a row | False | Can be useful for follow-up responses |
| `messages` | Initial messages to seed the conversation | [] | Useful for providing context |
| `send_introductions` | Whether to send introduction messages | True | Helps establish agent roles |

### Advanced Configuration

- **Custom Termination Conditions**: Define when a conversation should end based on specific criteria
- **Message Filtering**: Control which messages are visible to which agents
- **Agent-Specific Parameters**: Configure how individual agents behave within the group chat
- **Memory Management**: Control how conversation history is stored and accessed

## Agent Roles in Group Chats

Agents in group chats can take on various roles based on their capabilities and the task requirements:

### Common Agent Roles

1. **User Proxy Agent**: Represents the user in the conversation, often initiates tasks and provides feedback
2. **Assistant Agents**: Specialized agents that perform specific tasks or provide expertise
3. **Selector Agent**: Determines which agent should speak next (in SelectorGroupChat)
4. **Coordinator Agent**: Manages the overall conversation flow and ensures progress
5. **Critic Agent**: Evaluates solutions and provides feedback
6. **Execution Agent**: Performs actions like running code or accessing external tools

### Role Configuration

Agents can be configured with system messages that define their roles and responsibilities within the conversation:

```python
code_reviewer = AssistantAgent(
    name="code_reviewer",
    system_message="""
    You are a code reviewer agent specialized in analyzing Python code.
    When reviewing code:
    1. Check for correctness and whether it solves the stated problem
    2. Identify potential bugs or edge cases not handled
    3. Suggest optimizations for performance or readability
    4. Evaluate security considerations
    
    Provide specific, actionable feedback that would improve the code.
    """,
    model_client=model_client
)
```

## Message Flow and Processing

Group chats manage the flow of messages between agents according to their specific implementation:

### Basic Message Flow

1. **Initialization**: The group chat is created with a list of agents and configuration parameters
2. **Starting the Conversation**: An initial message is sent to the group chat
3. **Agent Selection**: The next speaking agent is selected based on the group chat type
4. **Message Processing**: The selected agent processes the message and generates a response
5. **Response Distribution**: The response is distributed to other agents based on the group chat configuration
6. **Termination Check**: The group chat checks if termination conditions are met
7. **Repeat or Terminate**: The process repeats until termination conditions are met

### Message Processing Pipeline

Messages in group chats go through several processing steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: Messages may be formatted or filtered before being sent to agents
2. **Agent Processing**: Agents process messages according to their configuration
3. **Response Generation**: Agents generate responses based on their capabilities
4. **Postprocessing**: Responses may be formatted or filtered before being distributed
5. **History Management**: Messages and responses are added to the conversation history

## Termination Conditions

Group chats can terminate based on various conditions:

### Built-in Termination Conditions

1. **Max Rounds**: The conversation terminates after a specified number of rounds
2. **Explicit Termination**: An agent explicitly indicates that the conversation should end
3. **Convergence**: The conversation reaches a stable state where no new information is being added
4. **Task Completion**: The task is completed based on predefined criteria
5. **Error Condition**: An error occurs that prevents the conversation from continuing

### Custom Termination Conditions

Custom termination conditions can be implemented by defining a termination function:

```python
def custom_termination(messages, max_rounds=10):
    """
    Custom termination condition that checks for task completion or max rounds.
    
    Args:
        messages: List of messages in the conversation
        max_rounds: Maximum number of rounds before termination
        
    Returns:
        Boolean indicating whether the conversation should terminate
    """
    # Check if max rounds reached
    if len(messages) >= max_rounds * 2:  # *2 because each round has at least 2 messages
        return True
    
    # Check for task completion indicator
    last_message = messages[-1]["content"] if messages else ""
    if "TASK COMPLETED" in last_message:
        return True
    
    return False

# Using the custom termination condition
group_chat = RoundRobinGroupChat(
    agents=[user_proxy, agent1, agent2],
    termination_function=custom_termination
)
```

## Human-in-the-Loop Integration

Group chats can include human participants through UserProxyAgent:

### Human Participation Modes

1. **ALWAYS**: Always ask for human input
2. **NEVER**: Never ask for human input (fully automated)
3. **TERMINATE**: Ask for human input only when the conversation terminates
4. **FEEDBACK**: Ask for human feedback at specific points

### Implementation Example

```python
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="FEEDBACK",
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=5  # Auto-reply up to 5 times before asking for input
)

group_chat = RoundRobinGroupChat(
    agents=[user_proxy, agent1, agent2, agent3],
    max_round=10
)

# Start the conversation
await group_chat.run("Please help me solve this problem: ...")
```

## Advanced Customization

Autogen provides several ways to customize group chat behavior:

### Custom Agent Selection

Custom agent selection logic can be implemented for specialized conversation patterns:

```python
def custom_agent_selector(group_chat, messages):
    """
    Custom agent selection based on message content.
    
    Args:
        group_chat: The group chat instance
        messages: List of messages in the conversation
        
    Returns:
        The next agent to speak
    """
    last_message = messages[-1]["content"] if messages else ""
    
    if "code" in last_message.lower():
        return next(agent for agent in group_chat.agents if agent.name == "code_reviewer")
    elif "security" in last_message.lower():
        return next(agent for agent in group_chat.agents if agent.name == "security_auditor")
    else:
        return group_chat.agents[0]  # Default to first agent
```

### Custom Message Filtering

Messages can be filtered or transformed before being sent to agents:

```python
def message_filter(message, agent):
    """
    Filter or transform messages before sending to agents.
    
    Args:
        message: The message to filter
        agent: The agent receiving the message
        
    Returns:
        The filtered message or None to skip
    """
    # Skip technical messages for non-technical agents
    if "technical" in agent.metadata and not agent.metadata["technical"]:
        if "code" in message["content"] or "API" in message["content"]:
            return None
    
    return message
```

### Dynamic Agent Addition/Removal

Agents can be added or removed from group chats dynamically:

```python
# Add an agent to the group chat
group_chat.add_agent(new_agent)

# Remove an agent from the group chat
group_chat.remove_agent(agent_to_remove)
```

## Performance Considerations

When implementing group chats, several performance considerations should be taken into account:

1. **Number of Agents**: More agents increase complexity and token usage
2. **Conversation Length**: Longer conversations consume more resources
3. **Message Filtering**: Efficient filtering can reduce unnecessary processing
4. **Parallel Processing**: Some operations can be parallelized for better performance
5. **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage is important for long conversations
