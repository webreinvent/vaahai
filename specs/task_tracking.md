## Current Blockers

None at this time.

## Next Steps

1. Implement user-friendly config initialization guidance (P4-T3) as the next priority task
2. Continue Phase 4 implementation with focus on enhancing the review command with dev features
3. Consider implementing `vaahai dev review` command skeleton (P4-T4) after completing P4-T3

## MVP Development Strategy

Phase 3 follows an MVP approach with these key principles:

1. **Incremental Testing**: Each task produces a testable component that can be verified independently
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic functionality and enhance with additional features
3. **Early User Feedback**: Create working components that can be demonstrated early
4. **Modular Design**: Each component is designed to work independently and integrate seamlessly
5. **Visible Progress**: Focus on features that demonstrate tangible progress to users

## Notes

- We are focusing on a minimal implementation with only the essential features
- The codebase will be kept lean and focused on the core functionality
- We will follow a step-by-step approach guided by user feedback
- Poetry will be used for dependency management and packaging
- Typer will provide the CLI framework with Rich for enhanced output
- InquirerPy will be used for interactive command prompts
