## Current Blockers

None at this time.

## Next Steps

1. Continue Phase 3 implementation with focus on report generators (P3-T11, P3-T12)
2. Implement HTML report generator (P3-T11) as the next priority task
3. Focus on implementing interactive code diff display (P3-T12) with Rich library

## MVP Development Strategy

Phase 3 follows an MVP approach with these key principles:

1. **Incremental Testing**: Each task produces a testable component that can be verified independently
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic functionality and enhance with additional features
3. **Early User Feedback**: Create working components that can be demonstrated early
4. **Modular Design**: Each component is designed to work independently and integrate seamlessly
5. **Visible Progress**: Focus on features that demonstrate tangible progress to users

## Notes

- We are focusing on a minimal implementation with only the essential features
- The codebase will be kept lean and focused on the core functionality
- We will follow a step-by-step approach guided by user feedback
- Poetry will be used for dependency management and packaging
- Typer will provide the CLI framework with Rich for enhanced output
- InquirerPy will be used for interactive command prompts

## Project Metrics

### Overall Progress
- Phase 1 tasks completed: 23 out of 23 (100%)
- Phase 2 tasks completed: 5 out of 5 (100%)
- Phase 3 tasks completed: 13 out of 18 (72.2%)
- Total project completion: 41 out of 46 (89.1%)

### Next Milestone
