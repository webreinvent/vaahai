## Introduction

This document serves as the primary Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Vaahai, an AI-augmented code review command-line tool. Vaahai leverages Microsoft's AutoGen framework and large language models (LLMs) to provide intelligent, context-aware code reviews across multiple programming languages.

The PRD is structured across multiple files to provide a comprehensive view of the product requirements:

- **Overview** (this document): High-level product vision and objectives
- **Features**: Detailed feature specifications and requirements
- **Technical**: Technical architecture and implementation details
- **User Stories**: User-centric scenarios and acceptance criteria
- **Implementation**: Development roadmap and implementation guidelines
- **Non-Functional**: Performance, security, and other non-functional requirements

## Product Vision

Vaahai aims to revolutionize the code review process by combining the power of static analysis tools with the contextual understanding of large language models. By automating the identification of bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code quality issues, Vaahai enables developers to:

1. Improve code quality systematically
2. Reduce the time spent on manual code reviews
3. Learn best practices through AI-generated suggestions
4. Apply recommended fixes directly to their codebase with confidence

Our vision is to create a developer-friendly tool that seamlessly integrates into existing workflows, providing immediate value while continuously learning and improving.

## Target Audience

Vaahai is designed primarily for:

1. **Software Developers**: Individual developers looking to improve their code quality before submission
2. **Development Teams**: Teams seeking to standardize and automate parts of their code review process
3. **Open Source Contributors**: Contributors wanting to ensure their submissions meet project standards
4. **Technical Leads**: Team leads looking to enforce coding standards across projects

The tool is particularly valuable for:
- Python developers (initial focus)
- Developers working with PHP, JavaScript, Vue.js (secondary focus)
- Teams with established coding standards but limited review resources
- Developers learning new languages or frameworks

## Business Objectives

1. **Primary Objectives**:
   - Create an open-source tool that demonstrates the capabilities of AI-augmented code review
   - Build a community of developers who contribute to and benefit from the tool
   - Establish a foundation for potential commercial extensions or services

2. **Secondary Objectives**:
   - Showcase the integration capabilities of Microsoft's AutoGen framework
   - Provide a reference implementation for LLM-powered developer tools
   - Gather insights on common code issues across different languages and projects

## Success Metrics

The success of Vaahai will be measured by the following metrics:

1. **Adoption**:
   - Number of installations/downloads
   - GitHub stars and forks
   - Active contributors

2. **Effectiveness**:
   - Percentage of valid issues identified (compared to manual review)
   - False positive rate
   - Successful fix application rate

3. **User Satisfaction**:
   - GitHub issue resolution time
   - Community engagement
   - Feature request implementation rate

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions

1. Users have basic familiarity with command-line tools
2. Target environments include macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL)
3. Users have access to either OpenAI API keys or local LLM capabilities via Ollama
4. Static analysis tools are available or can be installed in the user's environment

### Constraints

1. Initial language support limited to Python, with phased expansion to other languages
2. LLM performance dependent on model quality and prompt engineering
3. Processing time for large codebases may be significant
4. Local LLM performance may vary based on hardware capabilities

## Dependencies

1. **External Dependencies**:
   - Microsoft AutoGen framework
   - OpenAI API or Ollama
   - Language-specific static analysis tools
   - Python 3.9+ runtime environment

2. **Internal Dependencies**:
   - Configuration management system
   - Static analysis integration framework
   - LLM provider abstraction layer
