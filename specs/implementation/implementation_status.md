## Recently Completed Tasks

- CLI Application Skeleton (TASK-001) - Implemented the basic CLI structure using Typer, including command registration and argument parsing for all commands (review, analyze, config, explain, document)
- Configuration Manager (TASK-002) - Implemented the configuration manager to handle settings from multiple sources

## Currently In Progress

*No tasks currently in progress - implementation has not started.*

## Next Tasks to Implement

1. Code Scanner (TASK-003)
2. Basic Output Formatting (TASK-004)

## Implementation Notes

- The project is currently in the specification and documentation phase
- All core specifications and documentation are complete
- Implementation will follow the phased approach outlined above
- Each component should be implemented with corresponding tests
