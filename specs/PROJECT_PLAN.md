# VaahAI Project Plan

## Project Overview

VaahAI is a multi-agent AI CLI tool built with Microsoft's Autogen Framework, designed to enhance code quality and development workflows through AI-powered code review, auditing, generation, and scaffolding capabilities.

## Project Goals

1. Create a flexible, extensible CLI tool for code analysis and generation
2. Leverage multiple specialized AI agents for different tasks
3. Support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, Junie, Ollama)
4. Provide actionable, high-quality code feedback and improvements
5. Streamline developer workflows with AI assistance

## Project Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
- [P1-task-1] Project setup and repository structure
- [P1-task-2] Configuration management system
- [P1-task-3] CLI framework implementation with Typer
- [P1-task-4] Base agent architecture
- [P1-task-5] LLM provider integration (OpenAI, Claude)

### Phase 2: Autogen Integration (Weeks 3-4)
- [P2-task-1] Autogen framework integration
- [P2-task-2] Agent factory implementation
- [P2-task-3] Group chat management
- [P2-task-4] Language and framework detection agents
- [P2-task-5] Docker execution environment

### Phase 3: Review and Audit Capabilities (Weeks 5-6)
- [P3-task-1] Code reviewer agent implementation
- [P3-task-2] Code auditor agent implementation
- [P3-task-3] Reporter agent for output formatting
- [P3-task-4] Static analysis tool integration
- [P3-task-5] Applier agent for code modifications

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-8)
- [P4-task-1] Code generation capabilities
- [P4-task-2] Scaffolding functionality
- [P4-task-3] Git integration with committer agent
- [P4-task-4] Performance optimizations
- [P4-task-5] Advanced configuration options

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP will focus on core code review functionality with the following features:
- Configuration system with support for OpenAI and Claude
- Language and framework detection
- Basic code review capabilities
- Terminal output of review findings
- Simple configuration via CLI

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| LLM API changes | Medium | High | Abstract provider interfaces, version pinning |
| Autogen framework changes | Medium | High | Careful dependency management, version pinning |
| Performance issues with large codebases | High | Medium | Implement chunking, caching, and selective analysis |
| Security concerns with API keys | Medium | High | Use secure storage, environment variables |
| Accuracy of AI reviews | Medium | Medium | Implement human confirmation, continuous prompt improvement |

## Success Criteria

1. VaahAI can accurately detect languages and frameworks
2. Code reviews identify meaningful issues and improvements
3. Code audits detect security and compliance issues
4. Configuration is flexible and user-friendly
5. Output is clear, actionable, and available in multiple formats
6. Changes can be applied safely with user confirmation

## Team Structure

- Lead Developer: Architecture, core systems
- AI Specialist: Agent design, prompt engineering
- CLI Developer: Command implementation, user experience
- QA Engineer: Testing, validation

## Dependencies

- Python 3.9+
- Microsoft Autogen Framework
- Typer and InquirerPy
- LLM APIs (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
- Docker (optional for code execution)
- Static analysis tools

## Communication and Reporting

- Weekly progress updates
- GitHub issue tracking
- Documentation updates with each milestone
- Regular testing and feedback cycles

## Next Steps

1. Finalize requirements documentation
2. Set up development environment
3. Implement core configuration system
4. Begin agent architecture development
