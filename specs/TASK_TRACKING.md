## Current Blockers

None at this time.

## Next Steps

1. Implement [P1-T14] Set up development tools

## Notes

- We are focusing on a minimal implementation with only the essential features
- The codebase will be kept lean and focused on the core functionality
- We will follow a step-by-step approach guided by user feedback
- Poetry will be used for dependency management and packaging
- Typer will provide the CLI framework with Rich for enhanced output
- InquirerPy will be used for interactive command prompts
