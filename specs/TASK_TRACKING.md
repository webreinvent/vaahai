## Revised Implementation Plan

Our revised implementation plan focuses on delivering a minimal, functional CLI with the following core features:

| Task ID | Description | Status | Dependencies | Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| [CLI-1] | Build `vaahai config init` command | 游리 | None | Create configuration initialization command with default structure and customization options |
| [CLI-2] | Build `vaahai helloworld` command | 游리 | None | Create basic command with welcome message and interactive elements |
| [CLI-3] | Integrate Autogen AI Agent | 游댮 | [CLI-2] | Add Autogen dependency and connect agent to helloworld command |

## Current Tasks

| Task ID | Description | Status | Dependencies | Notes |
