## Feature Details

### Code Review

The core code review functionality analyzes source code using a combination of static analysis tools and LLM processing to provide comprehensive, context-aware reviews.

#### Requirements

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Accept file paths, directory paths, and glob patterns
   - Support filtering by file extension or explicit language specification
   - Handle large codebases through chunking or file selection strategies

2. **Context Building**:
   - Extract relevant code context for LLM processing
   - Include file metadata (name, size, language)
   - Incorporate project-level context when available

3. **Review Generation**:
   - Categorize issues by severity (Critical, Important, Minor)
   - Provide line-specific feedback with explanations
   - Suggest concrete fixes with code examples
   - Identify positive aspects of the code

4. **Review Management**:
   - Support different review depths (quick, standard, thorough)
   - Allow focusing on specific aspects (security, performance, style)
   - Provide summary statistics and overall assessment

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Successfully reviews single Python files with at least 90% accuracy compared to manual review
- [ ] Handles directories containing up to 20 Python files
- [ ] Provides meaningful, actionable feedback for common code issues
- [ ] Completes review of a typical file (200-500 lines) in under 60 seconds
- [ ] Correctly identifies at least 3 categories of issues (bugs, security, style)

### Static Analysis Integration

Integration with established static analysis tools to provide a foundation for the LLM-based review process.

#### Requirements

1. **Tool Integration**:
   - Support for pylint, flake8, and bandit for Python code
   - Extensible framework for adding language-specific analyzers
   - Consistent result parsing and normalization

2. **Result Processing**:
   - Aggregate results from multiple tools
   - Deduplicate overlapping findings
   - Normalize severity levels across tools
   - Format results for LLM consumption

3. **Configuration**:
   - Support tool-specific configuration files
   - Allow enabling/disabling specific tools
   - Provide sensible defaults for common scenarios

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Successfully runs pylint on Python files and captures output
- [ ] Correctly parses and categorizes pylint findings
- [ ] Aggregates results from multiple tools without duplication
- [ ] Handles tool-specific configuration files when present
- [ ] Gracefully manages missing or incompatible tools

### LLM Integration

Integration with Large Language Models to provide intelligent, context-aware code reviews.

#### Requirements

1. **Provider Support**:
   - Primary support for OpenAI API (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
   - Secondary support for local models via Ollama
   - Extensible provider architecture

2. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Optimized prompts for code review tasks
   - Context management for token limitations
   - Instruction tuning for consistent outputs

3. **Result Processing**:
   - Parse structured responses from LLMs
   - Extract actionable suggestions
   - Handle malformed or unexpected responses

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Efficient token usage
   - Caching mechanisms for similar queries
   - Fallback strategies for API limitations

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Successfully connects to OpenAI API with user credentials
- [ ] Generates contextually relevant code reviews
- [ ] Handles token limitations for large files through chunking
- [ ] Produces consistently structured outputs
- [ ] Completes typical reviews within reasonable time and cost constraints

### Interactive Fix Application

Capability to apply suggested changes directly to code files with user confirmation.

#### Requirements

1. **Change Parsing**:
   - Extract suggested code changes from LLM responses
   - Identify affected file regions
   - Generate clean diffs for review

2. **User Interaction**:
