# VaahAI Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview

VaahAI is a multi-agent AI CLI tool built with Microsoft's Autogen Framework that provides code review, auditing, generation, and scaffolding capabilities to enhance developer workflows and code quality.

## Target Users

- Software developers seeking AI-powered code assistance
- Development teams implementing code quality processes
- DevOps engineers integrating code quality into CI/CD pipelines
- Technical leads managing code standards

## User Stories

### Configuration

1. As a user, I want to configure VaahAI with my preferred LLM provider so that I can use my existing API keys.
2. As a user, I want to select which LLM model to use so that I can balance cost and performance.
3. As a user, I want to configure Docker usage for code execution so that I can ensure secure and isolated code analysis.
4. As a user, I want to verify my configuration is working with a simple test command so that I can confirm everything is set up correctly.

### Code Review

1. As a developer, I want to review specific files or directories so that I can get feedback on my code changes.
2. As a developer, I want to specify the depth of review (quick, standard, deep) so that I can control the level of detail.
3. As a developer, I want to focus reviews on specific aspects (quality, security, performance) so that I can address particular concerns.
4. As a developer, I want to see review results in different formats (terminal, markdown, HTML) so that I can use them in different contexts.

### Code Audit

1. As a technical lead, I want to audit entire codebases for security vulnerabilities so that I can ensure application security.
2. As a compliance officer, I want to check code against compliance standards so that I can ensure regulatory requirements are met.
3. As a developer, I want to identify performance bottlenecks in my code so that I can optimize critical paths.
4. As a team lead, I want to assess architectural patterns in the codebase so that I can ensure maintainability.

### Code Changes

1. As a developer, I want to apply suggested code changes selectively so that I can improve my code efficiently.
2. As a developer, I want to review changes before applying them so that I can ensure they meet my requirements.
3. As a developer, I want to commit approved changes directly to git so that I can streamline my workflow.

### Code Generation

1. As a developer, I want to generate code scaffolds for new features so that I can start implementation quickly.
2. As a developer, I want to generate code based on natural language descriptions so that I can implement features faster.
